<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>sopwith - classic aerial combat shoot em up game</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Sopwith is a modern port of the classic 1980s shoot 'em up game of the same name. The game has a World War I aviation theme. The object of Sopwith is to destroy all enemy targets with a somewhat limited airforce.</p>
<p>It can be played both in single player and multiplayer mode over a TCP/IP network.</p>

</dd>
<dt>S</dt>
<dd><p>turn on sound effects</p>
</dd>
<dt>Ctrl+R</dt>
<dd><p>restart the current game, only works in single player mode</p>
</dd>
<dt>Ctrl+Q</dt>
<dd><p>quit the current game, only works in single player mode</p>
</dd>
<dt>Ctrl+C</dt>
<dd><p>quit</p>
</dd>
<dt>Ctrl+C Ctrl+C Ctrl+C</dt>
<dd><p>quit immediately</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>DASHBOARD</h1>
<p>At the bottom of the screen, the plane's dashboard is shown. This consists of several components:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Score</dt>
<dd><p>Your current score, which is accumulated from the enemy targets and planes you have successfully destroyed. In multiplayer two scores are shown, so that both players can see each others' scores.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Lives (Cyan)</dt>
<dd><p>Number of lives remaining. You have five lives.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Fuel (Cyan)</dt>
<dd><p>Amount of fuel remaining in your aircraft. Once this becomes empty, you need to return to your home base to refuel, or your plane will crash.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Bombs (Magenta)</dt>
<dd><p>Number of bombs remaining. You can carry a maximum of five bombs. Once you have dropped all of them, you must return to your home base to get more.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Bullets (White)</dt>
<dd><p>Number of bullets left for your machine gun. Once you have used up all your ammunition, you mut return to your home base to get more.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Map</dt>
<dd><p>Shows the contents of the level. Cyan and magenta dots indicate the positions of allied and enemy planes and ground targets.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>TIPS</h1>
<p>The following are some tips for playing the game:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start off by playing in single player mode before playing against the computer. This will allow you to "get the feel of the stick" without being attacked by enemy planes. Practice dropping bombs on ground targets, as this is a key skill.</p></li>
<li><p>Accelerate to maximum speed on takeoff, otherwise you may stall the plane. Moving at speed is particularly important when playing against the computer, as you are otherwise likely to be outmanuevered by the enemy planes.</p></li>
<li><p>Bombs can be used against planes as well as ground targets. It can sometimes be easier to hit a plane with a bomb instead of the machine gun.</p></li>
<li><p>The machine gun can be used to destroy ground targets as well as planes. This can save time if you run out of bombs, and some targets at the edges of the map are even easier to destroy this way. Since the machine gun has a limited range, reducing your speed when attacking a ground target can give you more time to aim and attack before you have to pull away. But don't reduce the speed too much or the plane may stall.</p></li>
<li><p>Computer planes will try to tail you so that they can shoot you down. Don't allow them to get a clear shot. "Wiggling" the plane by repeatedly pulling up and down can be an effective evasive maneuver.</p></li>
<li><p>Firing your machine gun through a flock of birds will cause the birds to disperse, and the computer planes will sometimes hit a bird and crash. However, this tactic can also backfire for obvious reasons.</p></li>
<li><p>Each computer plane has a "territory" and if you escape that territory they will break off their pursuit. At the boundary between territories you can sometimes trick two planes into crashing into each other.</p></li>
<li><p>When your plane is crashing, the pull up/down keys still have a small effect on your trajectory. You can use this to try to crash your plane into a ground target.</p></li>
<li><p>Hitting the top of your screen stalls your plane. Hold down the pull up key to break out of the stall before your plane crashes into the ground.</p></li>
<li><p>The autopilot can make mistakes that lead to a crash. This is particularly a risk in higher levels if you're flying at very high speed. To avoid crashing, make sure that you're as close as possible to your home base before hitting the home key, and that you have a clear path to the runway.</p></li>
<li><p>It's possible to fly upside down, but trying to drop bombs while inverted is usually unwise.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>MEDALS</h1>
<p>If the "medals" game option is turned on, the player is rewarded with ribbons and medals for the following:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Flying Ace Ribbon (cyan with a single white stripe)</dt>
<dd><p>Shooting down 5 planes</p>
</dd>
<dt>Top Flying Ace Ribbon (cyan with two white stripes)</dt>
<dd><p>Shooting down 25 planes (difficult!)</p>
</dd>
<dt>Service Ribbon (cyan with white edges)</dt>
<dd><p>Three successful raids</p>
</dd>
<dt>Perfect Ribbon (white with two magenta stripes)</dt>
<dd><p>Finishing a level with no planes lost</p>
</dd>
<dt>Competence Medal (white medal on a cyan ribbon)</dt>
<dd><p>Gaining 25 points in a single flight, where 3 points are awarded per plane and 4 per building</p>
</dd>
<dt>Ribbon of Competence (white with magenta stripe)</dt>
<dd><p>As above, a second time</p>
</dd>
<dt>Purple Heart (magenta heart on a cyan ribbon)</dt>
<dd><p>Returning to base after having been damaged. This medal is impossible to attain if wounded planes are turned off.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Ribbon of Valour (magenta with white stripe)</dt>
<dd><p>Gaining a certain number of points for destroyed planes and buildings; the points depend on whether the player was damaged at that point in time, and how far away the destroyed object was from the player's base</p>
</dd>
<dt>Victoria Cross (cyan cross on a magenta ribbon)</dt>
<dd><p>As above, but a few more points</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Medals are only awarded if you get back to base safely. For example, if you destroy some targets but then crash, or if you shoot down a plane but get shot down yourself, it doesn't count.</p>

<h1>BUGS</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Multiplayer is currently very limited; only two player games are supported. The original game allowed up to four players per game when using the Imaginet network hardware.</p></li>
<li><p>Planes fly increasingly fast at higher levels and the game eventually becomes unplayable.</p></li>
<li><p>The plane AI (used for computer planes and for the autopilot) sometimes does very stupid things.</p></li>
<li><p>There is only one level.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Sopwith was originally developed by BMB Compuscience of Canada as a demonstration game for their Imaginet Networking System. The system was not commercially successful but Sopwith became a popular game for the IBM PC and compatibles. A sequel that is referred to by fans as "Sopwith 2" was actually a newer version rather than a different game, but included extra features, such as oxen and birds (the oxen being an in-joke reference to a BMB employee who was nicknamed "Ox").</p>
<p>The original author, David L. Clark, later released "Sopwith - The Network Edition" with several extra features including comical heads-up "splats" and wounded planes; a follow-up titled "The Author's Edition" contained the same features. This version of Sopwith is based on the released source code to the Author's Edition.</p>
<p>The real Sopwith Camel F.1 was one of the most famous fighter planes of World War I; Camel pilots shot down 1,294 enemy aircraft over the course of the war, more than any other aircraft. The plane gained a reputation for being agile but difficult to fly; many novice pilots crashed the plane on takeoff. The Camel was designed and manufactured by the Sopwith Aviation Company, founded by aviation pioneer Thomas Sopwith; 5,490 aircraft were produced. In popular culture the Camel is known for being the biplane flown by the protagonist in the <em>Biggles</em> series of novels, and by Snoopy in the <em>Peanuts</em> comic strip.</p>
