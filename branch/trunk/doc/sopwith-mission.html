<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>.sop - Sopwith mission format</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The Sopwith mission format allows <strong>sopwith</strong>(6) to load custom user-defined levels and other modifications to the game. The files use <a href="https://github.com/fragglet/yocton">Yocton</a> as their basic format.</p>
<p>Each .sop file can contain three different sections:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>level</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This section contains level data. If present, the game's level is replaced with an entirely new level defined within this section. See <strong>LEVEL SECTION</strong> below.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>symbols</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This section allows the game's symbols (sprites) to be replaced. This allows graphical modifications to the game. See <strong>SYMBOLS SECTION</strong> below.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>sounds</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This section allows the game's music to be replaced. See <strong>SOUNDS SECTION</strong> below.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>LEVEL SECTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>level</strong> section allows a complete new level to be defined. At present only a single level can be defined, although this may change in the future. Each level contains two types of subsection: <strong>ground</strong>, which defines the level's terrain, and multiple <strong>object</strong> sections, each of which defines an in-game object.</p>
<p>The <strong>ground</strong> subsection is a list of decimal integer values that describe the level's terrain. Each value is defined through a Yocton property named <strong>_</strong>. Values should be in the range 16-199, and there should be a minimum of 320 (ie. one screen's worth). The following is an example:</p>
<pre><code>  ground {
    _: 64 _: 64 _: 64 _: 64 _: 64 _: 64 _: 64 _: 64 _: 64 _: 64
    ...
  }</code></pre>
<p>Each <strong>object</strong> subsection defines an object that appears in the level. The following is an example:</p>
<pre><code>  object {
    type: PLANE
    x: 30
    orient: 0
    territory_l: 0
    territory_r: 0
    faction: PLAYER1
  }</code></pre>
<p>As seen, each object has a number of different properties:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>type</strong></dt>
<dd><p>See <strong>OBJECT TYPES</strong> below.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>x</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The X coordinate within the level where the object appears. The Y coordinate is set automatically depending on the object type and can not be specified.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>orient</strong></dt>
<dd><p>For planes, defines the direction in which planes face: 0 (right) or 1 (left). For ground targets, this controls the type of ground target; see <strong>TARGET</strong> TYPES below.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>faction</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Specifies the faction to which the object belongs. See <strong>FACTIONS</strong> below.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>transform</strong></dt>
<dd><p>For ground targets, this specifies a "transformation" to apply to the symbol. Eight different transformations are supported: 0 (no transformation); 1 (rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise); 2 (rotate upside-down); 3 (rotate 90 degrees clockwise); 4 (flip vertically); 5 (mirror, then rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise); 6 (mirror); 7 (mirror and then rotate 90 degrees clockwise). If you want to see an Ox do a headstand, this is the property to use, although it's more likely you'll want to use it to make tanks face the right direction.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>territory_l</strong></dt>
<dd><p>For planes, the left boundary of the range of the level the plane defends.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>territory_r</strong></dt>
<dd><p>For planes, the right boundary of the range of the level the plane defends.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The following is an example of a minimal <strong>level</strong> section that just contains a flat ground with no objects other than the player's plane:</p>
<pre><code>  level {
    object {
      type: PLANE
      x: 30
      orient: 0
      territory_l: 0
      territory_r: 0
      faction: PLAYER1
    }
    ground {
      _: 64 _: 64 _: 64 _: 64 _: 64 _: 64 _: 64 _: 64 _: 64 _: 64

  }</code></pre>
<h1>OBJECT TYPES</h1>
<p>The following object types can appear in a level:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>PLANE</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Defines either a player or computer-controlled plane. The <strong>faction</strong> property controls whether it is a human player or computer-controlled player; see <strong>FACTIONS</strong> below. Computer-controlled planes will defend their "territory", the range of which is defined by the <strong>territory_l</strong> and <strong>territory_r</strong> properties. If the player enters this territory, they will take off from their base and attack.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TARGET</strong></dt>
<dd><p>A ground target. The value of the <strong>orient</strong> property defines the type of target, see <strong>TARGET TYPES</strong> below. The value of the <strong>faction</strong> property specifies the faction to which the target belongs. When one player destroys all targets owned by all enemy factions, the game advances to the next level.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>BALLOON</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Observation balloon. The value of the <strong>orient</strong> property defines the type of balloon; 0 = spherical balloon, 1 = Caquot-style. The value of the <strong>faction</strong> property specifies the faction to which the balloon belongs.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>OX</strong></dt>
<dd><p>An Ox (type of cattle). The Ox does nothing except act as an obstacle, and does not need to be killed to advance to the next level. Does not appear in novice mode.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>BIRD</strong></dt>
<dd><p>A single bird flies the randomly around the level. The bird acts as an obstacle that the player(s) must avoid. Does not appear in novice mode.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>FLOCK</strong></dt>
<dd><p>A flock of birds moves along the top of the screen. The flock acts an obstacle and may disperse into many different birds if disturbed. Does not appear in novice mode.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>FACTIONS</h1>
<p>Military objects belong to a "faction"; objects allied to a different faction are considered enemies. The color of the object indicates the faction:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>PLAYER1</strong></dt>
<dd><p>For planes, cyan fuselage and magenta wings. This corresponds to the human player in single player mode, and player 1 in multiplayer mode.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PLAYER2</strong></dt>
<dd><p>For planes, magenta fuselage and cyan wings. This corresponds to the computer opponent in single player mode, and player 2 in multiplayer mode.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>NONE</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Used for animals / non-military targets.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The following values are also recognized; they are currently (effectively) unused, but may be used in the future if the multiplayer feature is extended to support more than two players.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>PLAYER3</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Maps to <strong>PLAYER2</strong> in single player mode, or <strong>PLAYER1</strong> in multiplayer mode. Planes of this faction are currently ignored in multiplayer mode.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PLAYER4</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Maps to <strong>PLAYER2</strong>. Planes of this faction are currently ignored in multiplayer mode.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PLAYER5</strong>, <strong>PLAYER7</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Maps to <strong>PLAYER1</strong>, but planes with this faction are currently ignored.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PLAYER6</strong>, <strong>PLAYER8</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Maps to <strong>PLAYER2</strong>, but planes with this faction are currently ignored.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>SYMBOLS SECTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>symbols</strong> section allows the game's graphics to be replaced. The section can contain a number of subsections, one for each type of graphic. Graphics are defined as multiline text strings. The following is an example of a <strong>symbols</strong> section that changes the hangar graphic to add an extra (white) flag:</p>
<pre><code>  symbols {
    swtrgsym {
      0:
      &quot;    -                 -         \n&quot; &amp;
      &quot;    - # # # #         - * * * * \n&quot; &amp;
      &quot;    - # # # #         - * * * * \n&quot; &amp;
      &quot;    -                 -         \n&quot; &amp;
      &quot;    -                 -         \n&quot; &amp;
      &quot;    -                 -         \n&quot; &amp;
      &quot;    -                 -         \n&quot; &amp;
      &quot;* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * \n&quot; &amp;
      &quot;* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * \n&quot; &amp;
      &quot;* * - - - - - - - - - - - - * * \n&quot; &amp;
      &quot;* * - * * * * * * * * * * - * * \n&quot; &amp;
      &quot;* * - * * * * * * * * * * - * * \n&quot; &amp;

      &quot;* * - * * * * * * * * * * - * * \n&quot;
    }
  }</code></pre>
<p>Graphics are limited to the original four CGA colors: black (space); cyan (asterisk); magenta (hyphen) and white (number sign / pound / octothorpe). Cyan and magenta are swapped for enemy planes (single player) and player 2 (multiplayer).</p>
<p>The following graphics are defined:</p>

<h1>SOUNDS SECTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>sounds</strong> section allows the in-game music to be replaced. There is only one property at present, named <strong>title_tune</strong>; its value is a string containing a sequence of notes to play. The following is an example of a <strong>sounds</strong> section that replaces the title music with the beginning of "Au Clair de la Lune":</p>
<pre><code>  sounds {
    title_tune:
    &quot;g4/r8/g4/r8/g4/r8/a4/r8/b2/r4/a2/r2/&quot; &amp;
    &quot;g4/r8/b4/r8/a4/r8/a4/r8/g2/r2/&quot;
  }</code></pre>
<p>As seen, the format consists of a number of musical notes (a-g) separated by '/' characters. The notes are in the C major scale. Each note is followed by a number that indicates the length of the note as a fraction of a whole note; for example, 2 means half-note, 4 means quarter-note, etc. The following additional syntax is also supported:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For a rest, use "r" instead of a note character. The syntax is otherwise identical to that for a normal note, with the only difference being that no note will be played.</p></li>
<li><p>To play a sharp, append a '+' character. For example, "g+4/" represents a quarter-length G#. Alternatively you can append a '-' to play a flat; for example "e-2/" is a half-length E-flat (aka D#).</p></li>
<li><p>Prefix a note with &lt; or &gt; to shift down or up an octave. All subsequent notes will be played in this octave.</p></li>
<li><p>Append a '.' character to play a dotted note. A dotted note plays for 50% longer than a normal note.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The original DOS version of Sopwith interpreted notes as being in the A minor scale, but this is believed to have been a mistake and notes are now assumed to be in the more common C major scale. This does, however, mean that tunes from DOS .exe hacks will play differently; any A or B notes will need to be shifted down one octave to convert to the C major scale.</p>

<h1>AUTHORS</h1>
<p>This manual page was written by Simon Howard.</p>
<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>The original DOS version of Sopwith only supported a single level, although later versions increased the difficulty by repeatedly playing the same level again at increasing speeds. Some modifications were made by fans by hex-editing the DOS .exe file.</p>
<p>Some simple hacks just changed the name shown on the title screen (one changed it to "Red Baron", for example). Some more elaborate mods that changed the level itself included "Blokwit" and "Sokwith". Andrew Jenner even developed a basic level editor that allowed people to make their own maps, although the changes that can be made using this technique are inherently limited.</p>
<p>Full support for custom maps did not appear until 2024, with SDL Sopwith's v2.4 release. There will likely be further future extensions to this format to allow people to share more elaborate modifications to the game.</p>
